# SOAR EDR Project - John Yang

Modeled an incident response playbook, navigated through the an EDR, and utilized SOAR to build the playbook to actuality. Then, ran a simulated event to check proper functionality.

## Intentions Behind the Project

When I started studying basic cybersecurity concepts, especially through my CompTIA Security+ exam prep, I noticed that many host intrusion-detection systems revolve around a simple idea. They would store a trusted hash, then keep checking for changes to verify integrity. I wanted to build something from scratch that reflected this concept with my security and coding knowledge.

## Playbook

| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Integrity checks | Re-computes SHA-256 every 5 seconds and compares to the baseline. |
| Human-readable logging | Appends timestamps and file paths to `logs/file_changes.log`. |
| Automatic log reset | Log file is truncated at launch so each session starts clean. |
| Pathlib-powered portability | Works on Windows, macOS, Linux without edits. |
| Smooth termination by Ctrl+C | Catches `KeyboardInterrupt` to avoid an unhandled traceback. |

## How It Works

1. Log reset/creation – At startup the script clears (or creates) `logs/file_changes.log`, so each run begins with a clean slate.  
2. SHA-256 hashing – Every file listed in `monitoring_list` is read and hashed with SHA-256. If the file hasn’t been seen before in the current session, its hash is stored as the original.  
3. Integrity monitoring, Change detection – On subsequent cycles the script re-hashes each file and compares the new value to the original.  
   * If the hash is different, the script prints a message, appends a timestamped line to the log, and updates the original to the new hash.  
   * If the hash is identical, no output is produced (the file is unchanged).  
4. Checking interval – The loop pauses for five seconds (adjustable by changing `time.sleep(5)`) before repeating the process.  
5. Terminate the script – Press Ctrl+C at any time; the `KeyboardInterrupt` is caught so the program terminates without an ugly traceback.

## Customizing Monitored Files

1. Open `fim.py`.
2. Edit the `monitoring_list`(absolute paths work as well):
    * EX:

    ```python
   monitoring_list = [BASE_DIR / "monitored_file.txt", BASE_DIR / "docs" / "Example1.txt", Path("/var/www/html/index.php")]
   ```

3. Save and rerun the script. New files will automatically receive an original hash that will be stored the first time they are seen.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to launch the File-Integrity Monitor on any machine that has Python 3.8 or later.

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.

2. Verify the monitored files list (see above).

3. Launch a terminal in the folder /File Integrity Monitor.

4. Run python fim.py.

5. When the script starts running, the output should look something like this: ![alt text](FIM1.jpg)

6. Stop the monitor by pressing Ctrl+C. The script will register the interrupt and terminate.

7. Look inside logs/file_changes.log to review records of every change detected during the session.

## Log Output

Each line records a timestamp and an absolute path, making the log easy to forward into a SIEM or parse with Splunk or an ELK stack.

## Cybersecurity Insights

* Allowed me to firsthandedly see the importance of algorithm choice. Going from MD5/SHA-1 to SHA-256 prevents realistic collision attacks and aligns with compliance guideilnes.
* Tangible tradeoffs result from even the smallest details when making security decisions. In this case, it was detection speed vs. resource cost. Experimenting with various checking intervals (1s-60s) showed how shorter intervals reduce attacker dwell time but raise CPU usage, ultimately guiding my choice to reach a reasonable balance at a 5s default interval.
* There is a lot to think about in security. This FIM script reliably flags changes on disk but misses other areas such as in-memory attacks completely, reaffirming the need for layed defenses and a multifaceted appraoch to security.
