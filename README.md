# SOAR EDR Project - John Yang

## Objective

This SOAR-EDR Integration project was designed to demonstrate the orchestration of automated security workflows using LimaCharlie (EDR) and Tines (SOAR). The primary objective was to configure and link these platforms to simulate real-time threat detection, response, and remediation. By automating actions such as alerting through communication platforms and endpoint containment, the project highlights the operational benefits of integrating detection and response tools. This hands-on implementation deepened practical understanding of modern incident response, threat intelligence integration, and the role of automation in scaling security operations.

### Skills Learned

- Hands-on experience configuring and integrating SOAR and EDR platforms (Tines and LimaCharlie).
- Proficiency in building automated security workflows for real-time incident response.
- Practical understanding of endpoint telemetry, threat detection, and response orchestration.
- Improved knowledge of API-based integrations and event-driven security automation.
- Strengthened ability to design scalable, efficient workflows for modern SOC environments.

### Tools Used

- LimaCharlie (Endpoint Detection and Response) for collecting endpoint telemetry and detecting threats.
- Tines (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) for building automated security workflows.
- Webhooks and APIs for integrating EDR alerts with SOAR playbooks.
- Custom workflow actions in Tines for automation of alerts and initiating response actions.
